Since MRA contrast agents are not nephrotoxic and are rarely associated with allergic type reactions, MRA without or with gadolinium-based contrast enhancement is an imaging alternative for patients who cannot tolerate iodine-based contrast media.<br /><br />Although MRA appears to be a rapidly developing technology, the clinical safety and effectiveness of this procedure for all anatomical regions has not been proven.  As a result coverage will be provided on a limited basis.  Below are the indications for coverage allowed for MRA.  All other uses of MRA will not be covered. <br /><br /><b> Indications</b><br /><br /><b> Head and Neck (Procedure codes 70544-70549)</b><br /><br /><i> <u> All</u> of the following criteria must apply in order for Medicare to provide coverage for MRA of the head and neck: <br /><br />a.       to evaluate the carotid arteries, the circle of Willis, the anterior, middle or posterior cerebral arteries, the vertebral or basilar arteries or the venous sinuses; <br /><br />b.       to verify the need for anticipated surgery for conditions that include, but are not limited to, tumor, aneurysms, vascular malformations, vascular occlusion, or thrombosis. Within this broad category of disorders, medical necessity is the underlying determinant of the need for an MRA. Because MRA and CA perform the same diagnostic function, the medical records should clearly justify and demonstrate the existence of medical necessity; and <br /><br />c.        MRA and contrast angiography (CA) are not expected to be performed on the same patient for diagnostic purposes prior to the application of anticipated therapy. Only one of these tests will be covered routinely unless the physician can demonstrate the medical need to perform both tests.</i><br /><br /><b> Chest (procedure codes 71555, C8909, C8910, C8911)</b><br /><br /><i> a.  Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism <br /><br />Patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast material face a high risk of developing complications if they undergo pulmonary angiography or computed tomography angiography. Therefore, Medicare will cover MRA of the chest for diagnosing a suspected pulmonary embolism only when it is contraindicated for the patient to receive intravascular iodinated contrast material. <br /><br />b.       Evaluation of Thoracic Aortic Dissection and Aneurysm<br /><br />Medicare will provide coverage only for MRA or for CA when used as a diagnostic test. However, if both MRA and CA of the chest are used, the physician must demonstrate the medical need for performing these tests.  While the intent of this policy is to provide reimbursement for either MRA or CA, CMS is also allowing flexibility for physicians to make appropriate decisions concerning the use of these tests based on the needs of individual patients</i> <br /><br /><b> Peripheral Arteries of Lower Extremities (procedure codes 73725, C8912, C8913, C8914)</b><br /><br /><i> Studies have proven that MRA of peripheral arteries is useful in determining the presence and extent of peripheral vascular disease in lower extremities. This procedure is non-invasive and has been shown to find occult vessels in some patients for which those vessels were not apparent when CA was performed. Medicare will cover either MRA or CA to evaluate peripheral arteries of the lower extremities. However, both MRA and CA may be useful is some cases, such as: <br /><br />a.       A patient has had CA and this test was unable to identify a viable run-off vessel for bypass. When exploratory surgery is not believed to be a reasonable medical course of action for this patient, MRA may be performed to identify the viable runoff vessel; or <br /><br />b.       A patient has had MRA, but the results are inconclusive.</i> <br /><br /><b> Abdomen (procedure codes 74185, C8900, C8901, C8902) and Pelvis (procedure codes 72198, C8918, C8919, C8920)</b> <br /><br /><i> a.       Pre-operative Evaluation of Patients Undergoing Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair (Effective July 1, 1999)<br /><br />The MRA is covered for pre-operative evaluation of patients undergoing elective AAA repair if the scientific evidence reveals MRA is considered comparable to CA in determining the extent of AAA, as well as in evaluating aortoiliac occlusion disease and renal artery pathology that may be necessary in the surgical planning of AAA repair.  These studies also reveal that MRA could provide a net benefit to the patient.   If preoperative CA is avoided, then patients are not exposed to the risks associated with invasive procedures, contrast media, end-organ damage, or arterial injury.<br /><br />b.       Imaging the Renal Arteries and the Aortoiliac Arteries in the Absence of AAA or Aortic Dissection (Effective July 1, 2003)<br /><br />The MRA coverage is expanded to include imaging the renal arteries and the aortoiliac arteries in the absence of AAA or aortic dissection. MRA should be obtained in those circumstances in which using MRA is expected to avoid obtaining CA, when physician history, physical examination, and standard assessment tools provide insufficient information for patient management, and obtaining an MRA has a high probability of positively affecting patient management. However, CA may be ordered after obtaining the results of an MRA in those rare instances where medical necessity is demonstrated.</i> <br /><br />Studies show that diagnostic evaluation of several upper abdominal malignancies may require an evaluation for vascular invasion by the tumor in deciding if the patient is a candidate for surgical resection of the tumor. One example is with pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic head carcinomas can grow in close proximity to the superior mesenteric vein. <br /><br />Evidence suggests that MRA provides reliable, noninvasive evaluation of the portal and hepatic veins. MRA can provide focused evaluation of particular areas of interest as well as a broad overview anatomic display that is helpful to surgeons and interventionalists planning procedures.<br /><br /><b> Limitations</b><br /><br />The following MRA services are NOT considered medically reasonable and necessary:<br /><br />MRA of the spinal canal and contents<br />MRA of the upper extremities","diagnoses_support":null,"icd9_dont_support_para":null,"icd9_dont_support_ast":null,"diagnoses_dont_support":null,"coding_guidelines":null,"doc_reqs":null,"appendices":null,"util_guide":null,"source_info":"FCSO reference LCD number(s) � L28925, L29218, L29447<br /><br />American College of Radiology (2001).
