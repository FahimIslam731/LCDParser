Their impact on any given individual depends on the individual�s over-all health status. Health status includes measures of functioning, physical illness, and mental wellbeing, as well as, environmental factors, such as the availability of palliative care services. The objective of this policy is to present a framework for identifying, documenting, and communicating the unique health care needs of individuals with cardiopulmonary conditions and thus promote the over-all goal of the appropriate care for every person, every time. <br /><br />Cardiopulmonary conditions may support a prognosis of six months or less under many clinical scenarios. Medicare rules and regulations addressing hospice services require the documentation of sufficient �clinical information and other documentation� to support the certification of individuals as having a terminal illness with a life expectancy of 6 or fewer months, if the illness runs its normal course. The identification of specific structural/functional impairments, together with any relevant activity limitations, should serve as the basis for palliative interventions and care-planning. Use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) to help identify and document the unique service needs of individuals with cardiopulmonary conditions is suggested, but not required.<br /><br />The health status changes associated with cardiopulmonary conditions can be characterized using categories contained in the ICF. The ICF contains domains (e.g., structures of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, functions of the cardiovascular and respiratory system, communication, mobility, and self-care) that allow for a comprehensive description of an individual�s health status and service needs. Information addressing relevant ICF categories, defined within each of these domains, should form the core of the clinical record and be incorporated into the care plan, as appropriate. <br /><br />Additionally the care plan may be impacted by relevant secondary and/or comorbid conditions. Secondary conditions are directly related to a primary condition. In the case of cardiopulmonary conditions, examples of secondary conditions could include delirium, pneumonia, stasis ulcers and pressure ulcers. Comorbid conditions affecting beneficiaries with cardiopulmonary conditions are, by definition, distinct from the primary condition itself. An example of a comorbid condition would be End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). <br /><br />The important roles of secondary and comorbid conditions are described below in order to facilitate their recognition and assist providers in documenting their impact. The identification and documentation of relevant secondary and comorbid conditions, together with the identification and description of associated structural/functional impairments, activity limitations, and environmental factors would help establish hospice eligibility and maintain a beneficiary-centered plan of care. <br /><br /><b> Secondary Conditions:</b> <br /><br />Cardiopulmonary conditions may be complicated by secondary conditions. The significance of a given secondary condition is best described by defining the structural/functional impairments - together with any limitation in activity and restriction in participation - related to the secondary condition. The occurrence of secondary conditions in beneficiaries with cardiopulmonary conditions results from the presence of impairments in such body functions as heart/respiratory rate and rhythm, contraction force of ventricular muscles, blood supply to the heart, sleep functions, and depth of respiration. These impairments contribute to the increased incidence of secondary conditions such as delirium, pneumonia, stasis ulcers and pressure ulcers observed in Medicare beneficiaries with cardiopulmonary conditions. Secondary conditions themselves may be associated with a new set of structural/functional impairments that may or may not respond/be amenable to treatment. <br /><br />Ultimately, in order to support a hospice plan of care, the combined effects of the primary cardiopulmonary condition and any identified secondary condition(s) should be such that most beneficiaries with the identified impairments would have a prognosis of six months or less.<br /><br /><b> Comorbid Conditions:</b><br /><br />The significance of a given comorbid condition is best described by defining the structural/functional impairments - together with any limitation in activity and restriction in participation - related to the comorbid condition. For example a beneficiary with a primary cardiopulmonary condition and ESRD could have specific ESRD-related impairments of water, mineral and electrolyte balance functions coexisting with the cardiopulmonary impairments associated with the primary cardiopulmonary condition (e.g., Aortic Stenosis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or Heart Failure). <br /><br />Ultimately, in order to support a hospice plan of care, the combined effects of the primary cardiopulmonary condition and any identified comorbid condition(s) should be such that most beneficiaries with the identified impairments would have a prognosis of six months or less.<br /><br />The documentation of structural/functional impairments and activity limitations facilitate the selection of the most appropriate intervention strategies (palliative/hospice versus long-term disease management) and provide objective criteria for determining the effects of such interventions. The documentation of these variables is thus essential in the determination of reasonable and necessary Medicare Hospice Services.<br />","diagnoses_support":null,"icd9_dont_support_para":null,"icd9_dont_support_ast":null,"diagnoses_dont_support":null,"coding_guidelines":null,"doc_reqs":null,"appendices":null,"util_guide":null,"source_info":"Carabello BA.
