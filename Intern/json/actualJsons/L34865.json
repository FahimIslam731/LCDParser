By analyzing the amount of energy released from tissues exposed to a strong magnetic field, MRA provides images of normal and diseased blood vessels as well as visualization and quantification of blood flow through these vessels.<br /><br />This LCD is a restatement of the National Coverage Determination for MRI and MRA documented in CMS Publication 100-03, <em>Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual,</em> Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 220.2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). <br /><br />Currently covered indications include using MRA for specific conditions to evaluate flow in internal carotid vessels of the head and neck, peripheral arteries of lower extremities, abdomen and pelvis, and the chest. Coverage is limited to MRA units that have received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval. In addition, the services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the specific patient involved. (CMS Publication 100-03, <em>Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual,</em> Chapter 1, Part 4, Sections 220.2.A.2 and 220.2.B.2).<br /><br /><br /><strong><u>COVERED INDICATIONS</u></strong><br /><br /><strong>I. <u>HEAD AND NECK</u></strong><br /><br />Studies have proven that MRA is effective for evaluating flow in internal carotid vessels of the head and neck. However, not all potential applications of MRA have been shown to be reasonable and necessary. All of the following criteria must apply in order for Medicare to provide coverage for MRA of the head and neck:</p><ul><li>MRA is used to evaluate the carotid arteries, the circle of Willis, the anterior, middle or posterior cerebral arteries, the vertebral or basilar arteries or the venous sinuses;</li><li>MRA is performed on patients with conditions of the head and neck for which surgery is anticipated and may be found to be appropriate based on the MRA. These conditions include, but are not limited to, tumor, aneurysms, vascular malformations, vascular occlusion or thrombosis. Within this broad category of disorders, medical necessity is the underlying determinant of the need for an MRA in specific diseases. The medical records should clearly justify and demonstrate the existence of medical necessity; and,</li><li>MRA and contrast angiography (CA) are not expected to be performed on the same patient for diagnostic purposes prior to the application of anticipated therapy. Only one of these tests will be covered routinely unless the physician can demonstrate the medical need to perform both tests. (CMS Publication 100-03, <em>Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual,</em> Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 220.2.B.2a).</li></ul><p><br />MRA is appropriately used to verify the presence of a condition, suspected because of findings from another test (usually an imaging study). For example, a patient who presents with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) should not undergo MRA simply because he might have a lesion which is amenable to surgery. However, if that patient has a carotid bruit and is found by Doppler study to have carotid stenosis, an MRA may be appropriate to evaluate the stenotic section of artery for surgical intervention. Please note that the anticipated surgery may be a percutaneous procedure such as carotid angioplasty with stent insertion.<br /><br />Another patient may present with a headache; it is not appropriate to proceed directly to MRA to rule out the possibility of an intracranial aneurysm. However, if that patient was found to have a clinically significant amount of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid, or the patient demonstrated signs and symptoms strongly suggesting an unruptured intracranial aneurysm, an MRA (or cerebral angiogram) may be appropriate. <br /><br />An MRA is not considered medically necessary for screening asymptomatic patients for intracranial aneurysms.<br /><br /><strong> II. <u> PERIPHERAL ARTERIES OF LOWER EXTREMITIES</u></strong><br /><br />Studies have proven that MRA of peripheral arteries is useful in determining the presence and extent of peripheral vascular disease in lower extremities. This procedure is non-invasive and has been shown to find occult vessels in some patients for which those vessels were not apparent when CA was performed. Medicare will cover either MRA or CA to evaluate peripheral arteries of the lower extremities. However, both MRA and CA may be useful in some cases, such as:</p><ul><li>A patient has had CA and this test was unable to identify a viable run-off vessel for bypass. When exploratory surgery is not believed to be a reasonable medical course of action for this patient, MRA may be performed to identify the viable runoff vessel; or</li><li>A patient has had MRA, but the results are inconclusive. (CMS Publication 100-03, <em>Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual,</em> Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 220.2.B.2.b).</li></ul><p><br /><strong> III. <u> ABDOMEN AND PELVIS</u></strong><br /><br /><strong>Pre-operative Evaluation of Patients Undergoing Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair</strong><br /><br />MRA is covered for pre-operative evaluation of patients undergoing elective AAA repair if the scientific evidence reveals MRA is considered comparable to CA in determining the extent of AAA, as well as in evaluating aortoiliac occlusion disease and renal artery pathology that may be necessary in the surgical planning of AAA repair. These studies also reveal that MRA could provide a net benefit to the patient. If preoperative CA is avoided, then patients are not exposed to the risks associated with invasive procedures, contrast media, end-organ damage, or arterial injury.<br /><br /><strong>Imaging the Renal Arteries and the Aortoiliac Arteries in the Absence of AAA or Aortic Dissection</strong><br /><br />MRA coverage is expanded to include imaging the renal arteries and the aortoiliac arteries in the absence of AAA or aortic dissection. MRA should be obtained in those circumstances in which using MRA is expected to avoid obtaining CA, when physician history, physical examination, and standard assessment tools provide insufficient information for patient management, and obtaining an MRA has a high probability of positively affecting patient management. However, CA may be ordered after obtaining the results of an MRA in those rare instances where medical necessity is demonstrated. (CMS Publication 100-03, <em>Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual,</em> Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 220.2.B.2.c).<br /><br />An MRA of the abdomen for evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis would not be considered medically necessary without some evidence consistent with renovascular hypertension. Such evidence might include:</p><ul><li>a history of early or late onset of hypertension, hypertension refractory to medication, or worsening renal function;</li><li>the presence of a renal artery bruit;</li><li>laboratory tests (elevated serum renins, increasing creatinine); or</li><li>other radiologic tests (ultrasound, captopril scintigraphy, or other imaging showing small kidney or unequal kidney sizes).</li></ul><p><br /><strong> IV.<u> CHEST</u></strong><br /><br /><strong>Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism</strong><br /><br />Current scientific data has shown that diagnostic pulmonary MRAs are improving due to recent developments such as faster imaging capabilities and gadolinium-enhancement. However, these advances in MRA are not significant enough to warrant replacement of pulmonary angiography in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism for patients who have no contraindication to receiving intravenous iodinated contrast material. Patients who are allergic to iodinated contrast material face a high risk of developing complications if they undergo pulmonary angiography or computed tomography angiography. Therefore, Medicare will cover MRA of the chest for diagnosing a suspected pulmonary embolism when it is contraindicated for the patient to receive intravascular iodinated contrast material.&nbsp;(CMS Publication 100-03, <em>Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual</em>, Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 220.2.B.2.d.i). <br /><br /><strong>Evaluation of Thoracic Aortic Dissection and Aneurysm</strong><br /><br />Studies have shown that MRA of the chest has a high level of diagnostic accuracy for pre-operative and post-operative evaluation of aortic dissection of aneurysm. Depending on the clinical presentation, MRA may be used as an alternative to other non-invasive imaging technologies, such as transesophageal echocardiography and CT. Generally, Medicare will provide coverage only for MRA or for CA when used as a diagnostic test. However, if both MRA and CA of the chest are used, the physician must demonstrate the medical need for performing these tests. (CMS Publication 100-03, <em>Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual</em>, Chapter 1, Part 4, Section 220.2.B.2.d.ii).</p><p>All other uses of MRA are non-covered unless coverage is specifically indicated.<br /><br /><strong> NON-COVERED INDICATIONS</strong><br /><br />The following MRA services are considered NOT medically reasonable and necessary at this time:</p><ul><li>MRA of the spinal canal and contents</li><li>MRA of the upper extremities</li></ul><p><br /><strong> NOTE:</strong> This LCD does not address cardiac magnetic resonance imaging delineated in CPT codes 75557-75565.<br /><br />As published in CMS IOM 100-08, Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1, in order to be covered under Medicare, a service shall be reasonable and necessary.
