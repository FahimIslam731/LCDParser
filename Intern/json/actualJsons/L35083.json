When billing for non-covered services, use the appropriate modifier.<br /><br />Compliance with the provisions in this policy may be monitored and addressed through post payment data analysis and subsequent medical review audits.</p><p><strong>History/Background and/or General Information<br /></strong><br />Cardiovascular nuclear imaging employs non-invasive techniques to assess alterations in coronary artery flow, as well as ventricular function. A variety of radionuclides may be used.<br /><br />The specific imaging technique (perfusion versus ventricular function) and the reason for the imaging determine what radionuclide agent is employed. In its simplest terms, a perfusion study utilizes an imaging isotope agent that reflects myocardial blood flow and, dependent on the agent and timing of image acquisition, the presence of scar or ischemia. Ventricular function studies utilize specific imaging isotopes to outline the borders of the left ventricular endocardium or to identify the ventricular blood pool independent of the surrounding myocardium. The motion of the left ventricle is synchronized with the electrocardiogram to generate wall motion and ejection fraction information. Both modalities may use rest and exercise images. <br /><br />In instances where an exercise test cannot be performed, provocative agents may be used to alter coronary flow, thereby unmasking a suspected lesion in the coronary bed. The acquisition of the images may be planar (single plane) or by multiple planes with computer integration, Single-Photon Emission Computer Tomography (SPECT).<br /><br /><strong>Covered Indications<br /></strong><br />Radionuclide imaging may be employed in the assessment of a variety of conditions associated with primary coronary artery disease. Some of these conditions include:</p><ol><li>Assessment of the functional and prognostic importance of angina, chest pain, or angina equivalent symptoms.</li><li>Diagnostic evaluation of patients with chest pain and uninterpretable or equivocal ECG changes occurring naturally or caused by drugs, bundle branch block, or left ventricular hypertrophy.</li><li>Risk assessment of re-evaluation of disease in patients who are asymptomatic or have stable symptoms, with known atherosclerotic heart disease on catheterization or SPECT perfusion imaging, who have not had a revascularization procedure within the past two years or greater than 2 years since last imaging study.</li><li>Detection of coronary artery disease in patients, without chest pain syndrome, with new-onset of diagnosed heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.</li><li>Evaluation of ischemic versus non-ischemic cardiomyopathy when cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography is not planned.</li><li>Evaluation of myocardial perfusion viability or function before and more than or equal to 5 years after coronary artery bypass surgery or greater than or equal to 2 years after percutaneous perfusion procedures, unless new clinical signs or symptoms necessitate reevaluation.</li><li>Quantification and surveillance of myocardial infarction and prognostication in patient with infarction.</li><li>Preoperative assessment for non-cardiac surgery, when used to determine risk for surgery or perioperative management in:<br /><ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\" type=\"a\"><li>Patients with minor or intermediate clinical risk predictors and poor functional capacity.</li><li>Patients with intermediate or high likelihood of coronary heart disease, or patients with poor functional capacity undergoing high risk non-cardiac surgery.</li></ul>The ACA/AHA 2014 Guidelines on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Care for Non-Cardiac Surgery (<em>JACC</em> 2014); provides the following information regarding categorization of surgical risk. They include:<ul><li>high risk/intermediate risk surgery: aortic and peripheral vascular surgery; intraperitoneal and intrathoracic surgery, carotid endarterectomy, head and neck surgery, orthopedic surgery and prostate surgery;</li><li>low risk surgery: endoscopic procedure, superficial surgery, cataract surgery, breast surgery, ambulatory surgery;</li><li>The Guidelines establish poor functional capacity as less than 4 METS;</li><li>Utilization of these tests is based on the presence of multiple risk factors, the level of functional capacity, the risk of surgery proposed, and the likelihood that the results of the cardiac testing would change the management.</li></ul></li><li>Evaluation of ventricular function in patients with non-ischemic myocardial disease.</li><li>Evaluation of patients in whom an accurate measure of the ejection fraction is needed to make a determination of whether to implant a defibrillator or biventricular pacemaker.</li><li>Evaluation of patient receiving chemotherapeutic drugs which are potentially cardiotoxic (e.g., Adriamycin, Herceptin).</li></ol><p>First pass studies will be considered medically necessary only when information sought is immediately relevant to the management of the patient&rsquo;s clinical condition and has not been previously obtained or likely to be obtained from other planned tests such as echocardiography or equilibrium gated blood pool studies. First pass studies may be indicated for the assessment and identification of shunts and are more likely to be done in suspected congenital events. It is noted that occasionally first pass studies and gated blood pool studies may be additive when RVEF is needed on the same day.<br /><br />Infarct Avid Scintigraphy is indicated in patients in whom it is not possible to make a definitive diagnosis of myocardial infarction by EKG or enzyme testing.<br /><br />Patient selection should be based on clinical grounds:</p><ul><li>Patients with a high pretest probability of disease are not usually candidates for a study for diagnostic purposes, though the size and reversibility of a defect and its functional consequences may be required for clinical decision-making.</li><li>Patients with a moderate probability of disease benefit the most from the study when the diagnosis is in question.</li><li>Selection of tests should be made within the context of other tests, scheduled and previously performed so that the anticipated information obtained is unique and not redundant.</li><li>Redundant testing where multiple tests are done revealing the same information is not medically necessary and should be appropriately denied if reviewed.</li></ul><p><br /><strong>Limitations</strong></p><p>The following are considered not reasonable and necessary and therefore will be denied:</p><ol><li>Given the limitations of uptake, low photon energy and redistribution, it would not be considered reasonable and necessary for the cardiac blood pool codes and perfusion imaging codes to be performed on the same date of service.</li><li>Cardiac blood pool imaging studies are described by the codes 78472, 78473, 78481, 78483, 78494&nbsp;and 78496.*&nbsp; It is not considered reasonable and necessary for more than one code from the series (78472, 78473, 78481, 78483, 78494) to be reported on a single date of service.&nbsp; *Providers should refer to the applicable Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Manual to assist with proper reporting of add-on code 78496.</li><li>All cardiovascular nuclear tests and stress tests must be referred by a physician or a qualified non-physician. (i.e., a Nurse Practitioner (NP) or Physician Assistant (PA)).</li><li>All stress tests must be performed under the direct supervision of a physician (even in a facility). The nuclear test components must be performed under the general supervision of a physician.</li><li>Myocardial perfusion studies performed based on the presence of risk factors in the absence of cardiac symptoms, cardiac abnormalities on physical examination, or abnormalities on cardiac testing (e.g., electrocardiographic tests, echocardiography, treadmill stress testing, etc.) will be considered screening and denied as not covered by Medicare.</li><li>Tests that are anticipated to provide information duplicative of another test already performed will be denied as not medically necessary.</li><li>Tests performed when the results would not be anticipated to influence medical management decisions will be denied as not medically necessary.</li><li>Myocardial perfusion studies performed subsequent to a diagnostic myocardial PET scan will be denied as not medically necessary.</li><li>Infarct avid scintigraphy will be denied if the diagnosis of myocardial infarction has already been confirmed by enzymes or EKG.</li><li>Tests performed unrelated to changes in a patient&rsquo;s signs or symptoms, or for immediate preoperative screening without signs or symptoms will be denied as medically unnecessary. Please see preoperative testing indications above.</li><li>Tests performed for risk assessment prior to high risk non-cardiac surgery in asymptomatic patients within one year following normal catheterization or non-invasive test will be considered medically unnecessary and denied.</li><li>Tests performed for preoperative evaluation in patients undergoing low-risk surgery will be denied.</li></ol><p><strong><br />OTHER COMMENTS</strong><br /><br />For claims submitted to the Part A MAC: this coverage determination also applies within states outside the primary geographic jurisdiction with facilities that have nominated Novitas to process their claims.<br /><br />Bill type codes only apply to providers who bill these services to the Part A MAC. Bill type codes do not apply to physicians, other professionals and suppliers who bill these services to the carrier or Part B MAC.<br /><br />Limitation of liability and refund requirements apply when denials are likely, whether based on medical necessity or other coverage reasons. The provider/supplier must notify the beneficiary in writing, prior to rendering the service, if the provider/supplier is aware that the test, item or procedure may not be covered by Medicare. The limitation of liability and refund requirements do not apply when the test, item or procedure is statutorily excluded, has no Medicare benefit category or is rendered for screening purposes.<br /><br /><strong>Notice:</strong> This LCD imposes diagnosis limitations that support diagnosis to procedure code automated denials. However, services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all of the indications and limitations stated in this policy, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, any and all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules.<br /><br />As published in CMS IOM 100-08, Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1, in order to be covered under Medicare, a service shall be reasonable and necessary. When appropriate, contractors shall describe the circumstances under which the proposed LCD for the service is considered reasonable and necessary under Section 1862(a)(1)(A).
