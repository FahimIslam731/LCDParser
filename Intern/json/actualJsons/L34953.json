When billing for non-covered services, use the appropriate modifier.<br> <br> <i> Compliance with the provisions in this policy may be monitored and addressed through post payment data analysis and subsequent medical review audits.</i><br> <br> Cardiac Event Detection involves the use of a long-term monitor by patients to document a suspected or paroxysmal dysrhythmia. Following the recording of events, the patient transmits data via telephone to a physician�s office or a specified station that is equipped and staffed to assess electrocardiographic data and to initiate appropriate management action. The device must be patient-activated.<br> <br> The CPT/HCPCS codes that follow have two key distinguishing features:<br> <br> <UL> <LI> The distinction between a monitor with and without pre-symptom loop.<br> <LI> The availability of full 24-hour attended coverage for certain specified services.</UL> <b> Indications</b><br> <br> The covered indications are:<br> <br> <ul> <LI> To detect, characterize and document symptomatic transient arrhythmias.<br> <LI> To aid in regulating anti-arrhythmic drug dosage.<br> <LI> To aid in the search for the cause of unexplained syncope, dizziness or giddiness.</UL> Based on the above covered indications, the following clinical scenarios would be considered consistent with the above indications:<br> <br> <UL> <LI> To detect the presence of symptomatic transient arrhythmias (the frequency of the symptom would make a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter), or even lengthier, but still intermediate (e.g., up to 14-day monitoring), not useful in documenting the rhythm).<br> <LI> To monitor for the purpose of regulating anti-arrhythmic drug dosages.<br> <LI> To monitor patients who have had surgical or ablative procedures for arrhythmias.</UL> <b> Limitations</b><br> <br> A Cardiac Event Detection service is medically unnecessary if it offers little or no potential for new clinical data beyond that which has been obtained from a previous test or if other tests are better suited to obtain the clinical data relevant to the patient�s condition. The Cardiac Event Detection should be coordinated with results from standard EKGs, Holter monitor, along with more intermediate (e.g., up to 14-day) monitoring tests and stress tests.<br> <br> <b> For 24-hour attended monitoring services</b>, the receiving station must be staffed on a 24-hour basis and should be able to direct the patient for the management of all emergencies. An answering service/answering machine would not fulfill this requirement.<br> <br> In addition, systems utilizing computers to dial the physician�s office so the physician receives transmission by way of a relay is not a covered service since there is no attendance.<br> <br> Cardiac event monitoring <b> must be 24 hours a day, seven days a week attended</b> for reimbursement.<br> <br> A test may be ordered only by a physician or qualified non-physician practitioner treating the beneficiary.<br> <br> Although the service is a 30-day service, it is recognized that the event recorder may be discontinued once the symptom-producing arrhythmia has been documented and diagnosed or following multiple transmissions during symptoms, without arrhythmia. It is unlikely that the arrhythmias would always be diagnosed on the first day of recording or that the service would always last only one day. The average duration of monitoring is anticipated to last 10�14 days or more.<br> <br> The Cardiac Event Detection service is justified by the pre-test incidence of symptoms related to arrhythmias and is considered not medically necessary for those patients who are not having significant recurrent arrhythmias that are anticipated to require treatment.<br> <br> Testing for more than 30 consecutive days is rarely medically necessary and the need for the continued monitoring must be justified by the treating physician. Failure to document an arrhythmia during a 30-day test period is not sufficient justification to reimburse a second or subsequent test. It is unlikely to be medically necessary to repeat a second test within a year in the absence of new or recurrent undiagnosed symptoms.<br> <br> Event recorders must be patient-activated and may not use time-sampling technology. Accordingly, this test will be considered medically unnecessary for any patient who is unresponsive, comatose, severely confused or otherwise unable to recognize symptoms or activate the recorder.<br> <br> Event recorders are not covered for outpatient monitoring of recently discharged post-infarct patients.<br> <br> Because the Cardiac Event Detection service requires the diagnosis and evaluation of intermittent arrhythmias and patients must be continuously attached to pre-symptom loop recorders or be able to be attached at the start of symptoms to post-symptom loop recorders, each patient is required to have a recorder for his/her own <u> exclusive</u> use throughout the duration of the monitoring period. Recorders may not be �shared� amongst two or more patients, regardless of the environment or site of the service. <b> It will be deemed medically unnecessary to perform cardiac event recording services when patients do not have exclusive use of a recorder for the entire service period (30 days). </b><br> <br> Cardiac Event Detection is a 30-day packaged service. Tests may not be billed within 30 days of each other, even if the earlier of the tests was discontinued when arrhythmias were documented and the patient is now reconnected for follow-up of therapy or intervention. <br> <br> <b> Notice:</b> This LCD imposes diagnosis limitations that support diagnosis to procedure code automated denials.
