When billing for non-covered services, use the appropriate modifier.<br /><br />Compliance with the provisions in this policy may be monitored and addressed through post payment data analysis and subsequent medical review audits.<br /><br /><strong>History/Background and/or General Information</strong><br /><br />Ultrasound of the extremity is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to evaluate the extremities (arms and legs including shoulders, hips, hands and feet), providing real-time, two-dimensional images. Longitudinal, transverse and oblique images of the area of interest are obtained. Musculoskeletal Ultrasound (MSK US) is highly operator dependent, making proper equipment and technique critical to obtaining an accurate examination. Basic knowledge of ultrasound physics and proper use of the controls are needed to produce adequate images.<br /><br />Ultrasound, echography and sonography are all terms that may be used interchangeably to describe this particular imaging technique. This LCD identifies the indications and limitations of Medicare coverage and reimbursement for these services.<br /><br />Per Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) guidelines, \"A complete ultrasound examination of an extremity (76881) consists of real time scans of a specific joint that includes examination of the muscles, tendons, joint, other soft tissue structures, and any identifiable abnormality.\" <br /><br />Medical record documentation must support the need for a complete examination and must include a report of the study findings that indicates all of the above structures were examined and the findings for each.<br /><br />According to CPT guidelines, &ldquo;Code 76882 refers to an examination of an extremity that would be performed primarily for evaluation of muscles, tendons, joints, and/or soft tissues. This is a limited examination of the extremity where a specific anatomic structure such as a tendon or muscle is assessed. In addition, the code would be used to evaluate a soft-tissue mass that may be present in an extremity where knowledge of its cystic or solid characteristics is needed.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong> Covered Indications:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Note: The two CPT codes addressed in this LCD (76881 and 76882) are for diagnostic purposes only and not to be used or billed for therapeutic purposes. </strong><br /><br />Non-Vascular extremity ultrasound examination (complete and limited) may be medically reasonable and necessary for the following conditions:</p><ul><li>To detect cysts, abscesses and effusions;</li><li>To distinguish solid tumors from fluid-filled cysts;</li><li>To evaluate muscles, tendons (including tears, especially those that are partial, tendonitis and tenosynovitis), joints, ligaments, soft tissue masses, nerve compression and stress fractures;</li><li>To aid in the diagnosis of and surgical removal of foreign bodies;</li><li>To evaluate plantar fasciitis unrelated to spondyloarthropathy when all of the following are met: <br /><ul><li>When only used once; AND</li><li>Only after a failed course of at least 6 months of conservative treatment; AND</li><li>Only when the medical records indicate that another disease process or pathology is indicated.</li></ul></li></ul><p><br />Please see the documentation requirements of this LCD below for information regarding proper documentation required to submit CPT codes 76881 and 76882. This documentation must be maintained in the medical record and made available to the contractor upon request. Please refer to Local Coverage Article A55037, Non-Vascular Extremity Ultrasound, for billing information.<br /><br /><strong>Limitations:</strong><br />Extremity ultrasound must be performed by individuals who possess the knowledge and skill required for the proper performance of this test. This includes, but is not limited to, physicians, Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Physician Assistants (PAs), or qualified technicians (sonographers). Sonographers, NPs or PAs must be under the general supervision of a physician. Documentation of training or qualifications must be kept on file and be made available to the contractor upon request.<br /><br />Extremity ultrasound (CPT codes 76881 and 76882) is limited to studies of the arms and legs. The upper extremity includes any part of the arm from the shoulder joint through the fingers including the clavicular and the scapular portions of the upper appendage but excluding the sternoclavicular joint. The lower extremity includes any part of the leg inferior to or below the inguinal ligament.</p><ol><li>Extremity ultrasound including but not limited to the following conditions is considered not medically reasonable and necessary and therefore non-covered:<ul><li>Avascular necrosis</li><li>Bunions</li><li>Chondromalacia patella</li><li>Cruciate ligament disorder</li><li>Hoffa&rsquo;s fat pad</li><li>Intra articular loose bodies</li><li>Labrum disorders of the hip or shoulder</li><li>Marrow disorders</li><li>Meniscal disorders</li><li>Neuromas</li><li>Os trigonum syndrome</li><li>Osteochondritis dissecans or osteochondral defect</li><li>Osteomyelitis</li><li>Paronychia</li><li>Peripheral nerve injections</li><li>Plantar plate injuries</li><li>Plantar warts</li><li>Sesamoid complex disorders</li><li>Shoulder dislocation</li><li>Spurs (including shoulder spurs)</li><li>Superficial abscesses</li><li>Superficial ganglia</li></ul></li><li>Bilateral studies are allowed only if there is pathology of both extremities dictating medical necessity for two distinct examinations. It is not reasonable and necessary to perform the contralateral extremity as a \"control\" or for comparison with normal.</li><li>In the case of plantar fasciitis unrelated to spondyloarthropathy, diagnostic ultrasound is NOT to be used in making an initial determination (diagnosis).</li><li>More than one complete ultrasound per joint, per extremity, in a 12 month period will be considered not medically necessary.</li><li>More than four extremity ultrasounds total in a 12 month period, complete or limited, will be considered not medically necessary.</li></ol><p><br /><strong>It is not expected that there will be routine cascading of tests from ultrasound to MRI and vice versa when imaging of extremities is medically necessary.<br /><br />Provider Training/Qualifications:</strong><br /><br />Physicians who perform or interpret diagnostic musculoskeletal (MSK) ultrasound (US) examinations must be licensed medical practitioners who have a thorough understanding of the indications and guidelines for MSK US examinations as well as a familiarity with the basic physical principles and limitations of the technology of US imaging. They must be familiar with the best method of imaging for extremity abnormalities. They must have an understanding of US technology, instrumentation, power output, equipment calibration, and safety. Physicians responsible for diagnostic MSK US examinations must be able to demonstrate familiarity with the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the anatomic areas that are being examined. These physicians must provide evidence of the training and competence needed to perform or interpret diagnostic MSK US examinations successfully, upon request. The training should also include methods of documentation and reporting of US studies.<br /><br />The diagnostic medical sonographer must be qualified, by appropriate training, to perform diagnostic US. This qualification can be demonstrated by certification for same by a nationally recognized certifying body.<br /><br />For frequency limitations please refer to the Utilization Guidelines section below. <br /><br /><strong>Notice:</strong> This LCD imposes frequency limitations as well as diagnosis limitations that support diagnosis to procedure code automated denials. However, services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all of the indications and limitations stated in this policy, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, any and all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules.<br /><br />As published in CMS IOM 100-08, Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1, in order to be covered under Medicare, a service shall be reasonable and necessary. When appropriate, contractors shall describe the circumstances under which the proposed LCD for the service is considered reasonable and necessary under Section 1862(a)(1)(A). Contractors shall consider a service to be reasonable and necessary if the contractor determines that the service is: <br /><br /></p><ul><ul><li>Safe and effective.</li><li>Not experimental or investigational (exception: routine costs of qualifying clinical trial services with dates of service on or after September 19, 2000 that meet the requirements of the Clinical Trials NCD are considered reasonable and necessary).</li><li>Appropriate, including the duration and frequency that is considered appropriate for the service, in terms of whether it is:<ul><li>Furnished in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's condition or to improve the function of a malformed body member.</li><li>Furnished in a setting appropriate to the patient's medical needs and condition.</li><li>Ordered and furnished by qualified personnel.</li><li>One that meets, but does not exceed, the patient's medical needs.</li><li>At least as beneficial as an existing and available medically appropriate alternative.</li></ul></li></ul></ul><p><br />The redetermination process may be utilized for consideration of services performed outside of the reasonable and necessary requirements in this LCD.</p>","diagnoses_support":null,"icd9_dont_support_para":null,"icd9_dont_support_ast":null,"diagnoses_dont_support":null,"coding_guidelines":null,"doc_reqs":null,"appendices":null,"util_guide":null,"source_info":"<p>Contractor is not responsible for the continued viability of websites listed.<br /><br />Abdel-Wahab N, Fathi S, Al-Emadi S, Mahdi S.
