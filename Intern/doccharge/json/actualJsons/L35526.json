It is secreted in response to ventricular volume expansion and pressure overload, conditions often present in congestive heart failure (CHF). Used in conjunction with other clinical information, measurement of BNP levels <em> (either total or N-terminal)</em> is useful in rapidly establishing or excluding the diagnosis or worsening of CHF in patients with acute exacerbation of dyspnea. Also, BNP levels determined in the first few days after an acute coronary syndrome or event (ACS) may be useful in the prediction of longer-term cardiovascular risk but this risk assessment does not change the management of ACS and is non-covered by regulation. <br /><br /><strong> Indications:</strong><br />BNP measurements may be considered reasonable and necessary when used in combination with other medical data such as medical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and chest x-ray.</p><ul><ul><li>to diagnose or to differentiate heart failure from other potential clinical conditions <strong> if</strong> the patient&rsquo;s signs and/or symptoms are consistent with both heart failure and one or more other conditions, e.g., acute dyspnea in a patient with known or suspected pulmonary disease.</li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li>to diagnose or differentiate worsening heart failure if use of the test replaces other diagnostic tests, such as chest film; and/or to confirm the diagnosis when other diagnostic tests are equivocal.</li></ul></ul><p><strong> Limitations:</strong></p><ul><ul><li>BNP measurements must be assessed in conjunction with standard diagnostic tests, medical history and clinical findings. The efficacy of BNP measurement as a stand-alone test has not been established yet.</li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li>BNP measurements for monitoring and management of CHF are non-covered. Treatment guided by BNP has not been shown to be superior to symptom-guided treatment in either clinical or quality-of-life outcomes.</li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li>The efficacy but not the utility of BNP as a risk stratification tool (to assess risk of death, myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure) among patients with acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction with or without T-wave elevation and unstable angina) has been established. However, the assessment of BNP level has not been shown to alter patient management. The BNP is not sufficiently sensitive to either preclude or necessitate any other evaluation or treatment in this group of patients.</li></ul></ul><ul><ul><li>Screening examinations are statutorily non-covered.</li></ul></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>","diagnoses_support":null,"icd9_dont_support_para":null,"icd9_dont_support_ast":null,"diagnoses_dont_support":null,"coding_guidelines":null,"doc_reqs":null,"appendices":null,"util_guide":null,"source_info":"<p>1.
