When billing for non-covered services, use the appropriate modifier. <br /><br />Compliance with the provisions in this policy may be monitored and addressed through post payment data analysis and subsequent medical review audits.</p><p><strong>History/Background and/or General Information</strong></p><p>Electronic analysis to monitor the patient&rsquo;s pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator is medically necessary on a regular basis to evaluate the device. Pre and postoperative evaluation of the cardiac rhythm device in patients with implanted ICDs or who are pacer dependent may be necessary because electromagnetic interference can alter the function of these devices, especially ICDs, in unpredictable ways. They may need to be re-programmed before and after a surgical procedure.<br /><br />The frequency of follow-up for monitoring purposes is determined by the patient&rsquo;s attending physician who takes into account the condition and circumstances of the individual patient. If the monitoring is done by some entity other than the patient&rsquo;s physician, such as a commercial monitoring service or hospital outpatient department, the physician&rsquo;s prescription for monitoring is required and must be renewed at least annually to assure that the frequency of monitoring is proper for the patient. When services are performed by entities other than the attending physician, such as monitoring services and pacemaker clinics, it is expected that the information obtained from these monitoring activities be communicated to the attending physician for use in the management of the patient&rsquo;s condition. This information must be documented in the patient&rsquo;s medical record.<br /><br />Appropriate frequency of monitoring of cardiac rhythm devices should be determined by the physician based upon multiple factors. Payment for services provided at a frequency that exceeds the national frequency guidelines listed in this LCD may be made by Medicare upon medical review if medical reasonableness and necessity for the services are documented.<br /><br /><strong> Transtelephonic Monitoring of Cardiac Pacemakers (93293)</strong><br /><br />Telephone monitoring of cardiac pacemakers is effective for identifying early signs of possible pacemaker failure, thereby reducing the likelihood of sudden pacemaker failures that require emergency replacement. Systems that monitor the pacemaker rate in both the free-running mode or the magnetized mode are effective at detecting subclinical pacemaker failure due to battery depletion. More sophisticated systems have the additional capability of detecting internal electronic problems within the pulse generator itself and other potential problems. In the case of dual chamber pacemakers in particular, such monitoring may detect failure of synchronization of the atria and ventricles and the need for adjustment and device reprogramming. For Medicare payment to be made, transtelephonic monitoring services must consist of the following elements:</p><ul><li>A minimum 30-second readable strip of the pacemaker in the free-running mode.</li><li>Unless contraindicated, a minimum 30-second readable strip of the pacemaker in the magnetized mode.</li><li>A minimum 30 seconds of readable (Echocardiogram) ECG strip.</li></ul><p><strong> National Medicare Frequency Guidelines for Transtelephonic Monitoring of Cardiac Pacemakers</strong><br /><br />Frequency guidelines for transtelephonic monitoring are divided into two categories: Guideline I applies to the majority of pacemakers now in use and Guideline II applies to pacemaker systems for which sufficient long-term clinical information exists to assure they meet the standards of the Intersociety Commission for Heart Disease (ICHD) Resources for longevity and end-of-life decay. The two groups of guidelines are further divided into single- and dual-chamber pacemakers. The frequency guidelines identified below represent the maximum frequency of transtelephonic monitoring that is expected to occur under routine follow-up. The frequency with which a patient is monitored may be changed for a number of reasons, such as a change in the patient&rsquo;s overall condition, a reprogramming of the patient&rsquo;s pacemaker and the development of better information on the pacemaker&rsquo;s longevity or failure mode.<br /><br /><strong> Guideline I</strong><br /><br /><u> Single-Chamber Pacemaker</u><br /><br />1st month &ndash; every two weeks<br /><br />2nd through 36th month &ndash; every eight weeks<br /><br />37th month to failure &ndash; every four weeks<br /><br /><u> Dual-Chamber Pacemaker</u><br /><br />1st month &ndash; every two weeks<br /><br />2nd through 6th month &ndash; every four weeks<br /><br />7th through 36th month &ndash; every eight weeks<br /><br />37th month to failure &ndash; every four weeks<br /><br /><strong> Guideline II</strong><br /><br /><u> Single-Chamber Pacemaker</u><br /><br />1st month &ndash; every two weeks<br /><br />2nd through 48th month &ndash; every 12 weeks<br /><br />49th through 72nd month &ndash; every eight weeks<br /><br />After 72nd month &ndash; every four weeks<br /><br /><u> Dual-Chamber Pacemaker</u><br /><br />1st month &ndash; every two weeks<br /><br />2nd through 30th month &ndash; every 12 weeks<br /><br />31st through 48th month &ndash; every eight weeks<br /><br />After 48th month &ndash; every four weeks<br /><br /><strong> Pacemaker Clinic Services</strong><br /><br />Pacemaker monitoring (procedure codes 93279, 93280, 93281, 93288, 93294 and 93724) is covered by pacemaker clinics and may be done in conjunction with transtelephonic monitoring, remote monitoring, or as a separate service. The services rendered by a pacemaker clinic are more extensive than those currently possible by telephone. They include, for example, physical examination of patients and reprogramming of pacemakers.<br /><br />The frequency of pacemaker clinic services is the decision of the patient&rsquo;s physician, taking into account the medical condition of the patient. The following monitoring guidelines apply to lithium battery pacemakers (all pacemakers currently have lithium batteries) when transtelephonic monitoring is used:</p><ul><li>Single-chamber pacemakers &ndash; twice in the first six months following implant, then once every 12 months, unless intervening potential complications (e.g., otherwise unexplained syncope) should warrant additional, more frequent attention.</li><li>Dual-chamber pacemakers &ndash; twice in the first six months, then once every six months.</li></ul><p>Consistent with CPT guidelines, when reporting rhythm strip and interrogation device monitoring, CPT codes 93293-93296, the services may be reported only once every 90 days. <br /><br />For instances where a patient is monitored both during clinic visits and remotely or transtelephonically, the combined frequency of monitoring will be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of the frequency of monitoring services received by the patient.<br /><br /><strong> Note</strong>: Payment for dual-chamber pacemakers operating in single-chamber mode should be made at the same frequency as monitoring of a single-chamber pacemaker.<br /><br /><strong> Local Medicare Frequency Guidelines for Monitoring of Cardioverter-Defibrillators</strong><br /><br />Electronic analysis of a pacing cardioverter-defibrillator (procedure codes 93260, 93261, 93282, 93283, 93284, 93289 and 93295) is performed in an office or outpatient hospital setting. It involves the interrogation and evaluation of the pulse generator status in addition to evaluation of the programmable parameters, analysis of event markers, and device response during periods of rest and activity. The monitoring of these complex devices requires more frequent monitoring than a single- or dual-chamber pacemaker. Therefore, Medicare will allow routine electronic analysis of a pacing cardioverter-defibrillator (single- and dual-chamber) within one month following implantation and then every three months thereafter. More frequent testing may be necessary to evaluate patient symptoms suggestive of pacing cardioverter-defibrillator involvement/origin.<br /><br /><strong> Wearable Defibrillator System</strong><br /><br />Payment for wearable defibrillators is made by Durable Medical Equipment contractors and is subject to the indications and limitations in the DME Local Coverage Determination &ldquo;Automatic External Defibrillators.&rdquo;<br /><br />Use CPT code 93292 when billing Medicare Part B for the analysis of a wearable defibrillator system. Coverage (including frequency) for monitoring the wearable system is identical to that of implantable defibrillator devices.<br /><br />For frequency limitations please refer to the Utilization Guidelines section below.<br /><br /><strong>Notice:</strong> This LCD imposes frequency limitations as well as diagnosis limitations that support diagnosis to procedure code automated denials. However, services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all of the indications and limitations stated in this policy, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, any and all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules. <br /><br />As published in CMS IOM 100-08, Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1, in order to be covered under Medicare, a service shall be reasonable and necessary.
