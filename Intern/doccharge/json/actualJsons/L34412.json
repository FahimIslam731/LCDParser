This LCD encompasses Phase II CR. Phase II programs are typically initiated one to three weeks after hospital discharge in the case of acute cardiac events such as MI or cardiac surgery and consist of a series of medically supervised exercise sessions with Continuous Electrocardiograph Monitoring (CEM). Clinically optimal results are obtained if these sessions are conducted two to three times per week over a 12&ndash;18-week period, generally for a total of 36 sessions. <br /><br /><strong>Phases of Cardiac Rehabilitation</strong><br /><br />&bull; Phase I: Acute in-hospital phase of CR. This is included in the hospital care for the acute illness and is not included under the CR benefit.<br />&bull; Phase II: For the purposes of this LCD, Phase II is divided into: <br />- Phase IIA and Phase IIB. <br />- Phase IIA is the initial outpatient CR, consisting of 36 or fewer sessions, occurring up to two sessions per day.<br />- Phase IIB consists of up to an additional 36 sessions and will only be allowed if determined medically necessary. Phase IIB benefits must meet additional medical necessity criteria. Specifically, there must be clear demonstration that the patient is benefiting from CR and that the exit criteria below from phase IIA have not yet been met. The maximum total number of allowable sessions under Phase IIA and IIB combined is 72.<br />&bull; Phase III: CR programs that are self-directed or self-controlled/monitored exercise programs.<br />&bull; Phase IV: CR programs or maintenance therapy that may be safely carried out without medical supervision. <br /><br /><strong>NOTE: Phase III CR programs do not meet the supervisory requirements of the benefit and are not covered under Medicare. Phase IV CR programs do require medical supervision and therefore are not covered under Medicare.<br /><br /><u>Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) and Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation (ICR)</u></strong> <br /><br />An individualized treatment plan is a written plan tailored to each individual patient that includes all of the following:<br /><br />&bull; A description of the individual&rsquo;s diagnosis.<br />&bull; The type, amount, frequency and duration of the items and services furnished under the plan.<br />&bull; Must be established, reviewed and signed by a physician every 30 days.<br />&bull; The goals set for the individual under the plan.<br /><br /><strong>CR and ICR are covered for the following patients:</strong><br /><br />&bull; Patients who begin the program within 12 months of an acute Myocardial Infarction (MI);<br />&bull; Patients who have had Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery;<br />&bull; Patients with current, stable angina pectoris;<br />&bull; Patients who have had heart valve repair/replacement;<br />&bull; Patients who have had Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary stenting;<br />&bull; Patients who have had a heart or heart-lung transplant <br /><br /><strong>For Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) Only: </strong><em>Stable, chronic heart failure defined as patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV symptoms despite being on optimal heart failure therapy for at least 6 weeks (Effective February 18, 2014). Stable patients are defined as patients who have not had recent (=6 weeks) or planned (=6 months) major cardiovascular hospitalizations or procedures.</em><br /> <br /><strong>Facilities</strong><br /><br />For CR/ICR programs provided in the outpatient department of a hospital, coverage is subject to the following conditions: <br /><br />&bull; The facility is a hospital outpatient department or a physician&rsquo;s office.<br />&bull; The facility has available for immediate use all the necessary cardiopulmonary emergency diagnostic and therapeutic life-saving equipment accepted by the medical community as medically necessary, e.g., oxygen, cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment or defibrillator.<br />&bull; The program is staffed by personnel necessary to conduct the program safely and effectively and who are trained in both basic and advanced life support techniques and in exercise therapy for coronary disease. <br /><br /><strong>Physician responsibility</strong><br /><br />There are two categories of responsibility that require a physician (MD or DO). One is that of medical director; the physician(s) with directorial responsibility for the CR or ICR program. <em>The medical director in consultation with staff is involved in directing the progress of individuals in the program.</em> This individual must possess all of the following: <em>(1) expertise in the management of individuals with cardiac pathophysiology; (2) cardiopulmonary training in basic life support or advanced cardiac life support; and (3) a license to practice medicine in the state in which the CR or ICR program is offered.</em> The other physician responsibility is that of supervising physician. This could be the same individual as the medical director, but that is not required. An identified supervising physician must also possess the same three specific characteristics listed for the medical director. The supervising physician must be immediately available at all times while cardiac rehabilitation services are being rendered. This does not require that a physician be physically present in the exercise room itself but <strong><em>must be immediately available and accessible</em></strong> at all times. It should also be noted that non-physician practitioners (NPP's) may not serve in the medical director role or supervisory role for cardiac rehabilitation programs. <br /><br /><strong>Diagnoses</strong><br /> <br />For myocardial infraction, the date of entry into the program must be within 12 months of the date of infarction.<br /> <br /><strong>Frequency and Duration</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;\"> <strong><em><span style=\"line-height: 96%; letter-spacing: -0.05pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;\">NOTE</span></em></strong><em><span style=\"line-height: 96%; letter-spacing: -0.05pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;\">: </span></em><em><span style=\"line-height: 96%; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;\">A<span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\"> beneficiary</span> may<span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\"> switch</span> from an <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\">ICR </span>program to a CR<span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\"> program.</span> <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\">The beneficiary </span>is <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\">limited</span> to a <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\">one-time switch,</span> <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\">multiple switches</span> are not <span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.05pt;\">allowable.

A patient with unstable angina or a patient status post-non-cardiac surgery will not qualify for CR services unless the latter surgical intervention has been documented to exacerbate the underlying cardiac condition.<br />&bull; Acute congestive heart failure is not included as a covered condition of CR. <br /><br /><strong>Other Services</strong><br /> <br />&bull; Evaluation and Management (E/M) services, Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and other diagnostic services may be covered on the day of CR if these services are separate and distinct from the CR program and are reasonable and necessary, but would not be covered if provided routinely as part of the CR program.<br /><br />Forms of counseling, such as dietary counseling, psychosocial intervention, lipid management and stress management, are components of the CR program and are not separately reimbursed.<br /><br /><strong>Exit Criteria</strong> <br /><br />Once a patient has reached the following, further CR may not be considered reasonable and necessary unless medical record documentation clearly indicates otherwise:<br /><br />&bull; Ischemic heart disease; Chronic Heart Failure: Patient&rsquo;s status following MI, CABG, PTCA or stent, and patients with angina undergoing stress testing without demonstrating significant ischemia or dysrhythmia after completion of six minutes of a Bruce protocol, or equivalent, achieving a stable level of exercise tolerance (7 METS). (See the American Heart Association&rsquo;s functional classification: Class I, or normal function status, begins at 7 metabolic equivalent units (METS)).<br />&bull; Following valve repair/replacement: Patients achieving a stable level of exercise tolerance (7 METS).<br />&bull; Heart and heart-lung transplant patients: Issues such as deconditioning and cachexic deterioration may complicate the definition of reasonable exit criteria. Based on the study of long term cardiopulmonary exercise performed after heart transplant (Osada et al), a peak oxygen consumption (VO2) of greater than 90 percent of predicted will be used as the exit criterion for phase IIA. Patients whose peak VO2 is less than 90 percent of predicted may qualify for phase IIB.<br /><br />In addition to the exercise/physiologic criteria listed above, the patient should also be ready for transition as manifested by progress toward the cognitive and functional goals identified and addressed during the program. <br /><br /><strong><u>Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation (ICR)</u></strong><br /><br />Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation (ICR) services must include the comprehensive program components of a CR program.

Although Medicare allows up to these maximums, each patient&rsquo;s condition and response to treatment must medically warrant the number of services reported for payment. Medicare requires the medical necessity for each service reported to be clearly demonstrated in the patient&rsquo;s medical record. Medicare expects that patients will not routinely require the maximum allowable number of services.<br /><br /><strong> Notice:</strong> This LCD imposes diagnosis limitations that support diagnosis to procedure code automated denials. However, services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all of the indications and limitations stated in this policy, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, any and all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules.<br /><br />For services to be covered under Medicare, a service shall be reasonable and necessary. When appropriate, contractors shall describe the circumstances under which the proposed LCD for the service is considered reasonable and necessary. Contractors shall consider a service to be reasonable and necessary if the contractor determines that the service is: <br /><br /></p><ul><li>Safe and effective.</li><li>Not experimental or investigational (exception: routine costs of qualifying clinical trial services with dates of service on or after July 9, 2007, that meet the requirements of the Clinical Trials NCD, are considered reasonable and necessary).</li><li>Appropriate, including the duration and frequency that is considered appropriate for the service, in terms of whether it is: <br /><ul><li>Furnished in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's condition or to improve the function of a malformed body member.</li><li>Furnished in a setting appropriate to the patient's medical needs and condition.</li><li>Ordered and furnished by qualified personnel.</li><li>One that meets, but does not exceed, the patient's medical needs.</li><li>At least as beneficial as an existing and available medically appropriate alternative.</li></ul></li></ul>","notice_end_dt":null,"date_retired":null,"draft_released_date":null,"icd10_doc":"Y","synopsis_changes":null,"bibliography":"<p>Ades PA.
